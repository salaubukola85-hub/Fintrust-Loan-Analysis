# FINTRUST LOAN & REPAYMENT ANALYSIS
A complete end-to-end data analytics project using **SQL** and **Power BI**, focused on understanding loan distribution, repayment behavior, and default patterns across customer groups, employment types, and regions.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes:
- Loan disbursement patterns
- Repayment performance
- Default rates
- Customer financial behavior
- High-risk segments and regions.

The dataset consists of three merged tables:
- Customers
- Loans and
- Payments.

SQL was used for data transformation and KPI calculations.
Power BI was used to build the dashboards.

# Tools & Technologies
- SQL (joins, aggregations, KPIs)
- Power BI (data modeling, dashboards)

# Power BI Dashboards
- Loan Analysis Dashboard ![Dashboard Screenshot](<img width="460" height="379" alt="Fintrust Loan Dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e06e0c3-07b8-4794-a88e-9ac76ad6a66b"/>)

Quarterly Portfolio Review
- Track repayment trends
- Flag loans >60 days overdue
- Use predictive modeling for default probability

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full Power BI workflow, from SQL based cleaning and modeling to Power BI dashboard development.
The insights generated can help enhance credit risk management, improve repayment behavior, and support better lending decisions.
